Intoroduction into Module Federation, the React Parts
...
2 more parts...

Always have plan B when your federated component fails
6
Suspense your federated component with caution
You have already created multiple federated react apps, and you still wondering, how can I share not just components in the runtime, but the entire store between the apps.

There are two notes here to consider:

Module Federation is meant to share any JS/TS module not just UI component.
The key into sharing the store is by exposing the reducers from our app into the host.
Work in action!!
Firstly clone the repo, or click here to navigate through the code without installing
git clone https://github.com/IbrahimShamma99/gentle-intro-module-federation-react 
cd ./gentle-intro-module-federation-react
Now let's examine the Repo, we have two react apps built with webpack, app1 and host

app1: will contain the store that will be exposed

host: it will consume the store from app1

So now how can we share the store?

Remote set up
While we are preparing the store in order to be consumed, we are here preparing a normal store that will consumed normally inside the remote (remote and app1 are the same I will use both interchangeably), and we will expose the reduces and that's it!

Exposing the Store in action!
first let's set up a store and reducer inside the remote
Firstly we are setting up a layout slice that will handle storing and toggling theme.
// apps/app1/src/reducer.ts

import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

type Theme = "light" | "dark";

export interface LayoutState {
  theme: Theme;
}

const initialState: LayoutState = {
  theme: "light",
};

const layoutSlice = createSlice({
  name: "layout",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    toggleTheme: (state, action) => {
      state.theme = action.payload as Theme;
    },
  },
});

export const { toggleTheme } = layoutSlice.actions;

export { layoutSlice };

export default layoutSlice;
And Now besides the reducer, we will create the store, although we will not share the store between apps, since redux only combines reducers not stores, but the store is crucial for the mutating the reducer inside the remote

NOTE: You can expose the reducers and be able to access the store, but preferably don't use actions outside of the remote

To create the remote store by simply:
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import { useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import { combineReducers } from "redux";
import { layoutSlice } from "./reducer";

const Store = configureStore({
  reducer: combineReducers({
    layout: layoutSlice.reducer,
  }),
});

export { Store };
export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof Store.getState>;
export type AppDispatch = typeof Store.dispatch;
export const useAppDispatch = () => useDispatch<AppDispatch>();
now in module federation remote app configuration we need to do the following
// apps/app1/configs/federationConfig.js
const dependencies = require("../package.json").dependencies;

module.exports = {
  name: "app1",
  filename: "remoteEntry.js",
//This is what is important, exposing our reducer
  exposes: {
    "./layout-slice": "./src/reducer",
  },
  shared: {
    ...dependencies,
    react: {
      singleton: true,
      requiredVersion: dependencies["react"],
    },
    "react-dom": {
      singleton: true,
      requiredVersion: dependencies["react-dom"],
    },
  },
};
Now we have finished setting up and exposing the remote store, now we go into the host part

Host set up
Now we need to do one unconventional thing in the redux world, instead of importing all of our reducers like what we do normally synchronously, we will dynamically build the store, and we will have two approaches

When loading the page wait until the Store is imported then continue upon rendering.
Load Redux microfrontend framework Click Here
we will use the first approach since the latter needs a blog by its own.

we need to set up the host store now:
//apps/host/src/store.tsx

import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import { combineReducers } from "redux";

/*
NOTE: 
Here you take the interface of each slice and pass them into the `useStoreSelector` Hook in this way your `intellisense` will be aware of the federated types.
*/
const federatedSlices = {
  layout: await import("app1/layout-slice").then(
    (module) => module.default.reducer
  ),
};

const initStore = async () => {
  const Store = configureStore({
    reducer: combineReducers({
      ...federatedSlices,
    }),
  });
  return Store;
};

export default initStore;
As you can see in the code the store is initialized asynchronously, so the dom will be waiting our initStore promise to be fulfilled:
//apps/host/src/bootstrap.tsx

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import initStore from "./store";

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(
  document.getElementById("root") as HTMLElement
);

initStore().then((Store) => {
  root.render(
    <Provider store={Store}>
      <App />
    </Provider>
  );
});
NOTE make sure that the host already connected into the remote via config, if you could not make a lot of sense here, better to look up the following article.

🚨 This article based on this article. I just added some extra features.

Author

In today's rapidly evolving world of web development, embracing micro front-end architecture has become a strategic imperative. This article presents a comprehensive guide that navigates through the intricate landscape of micro front-ends, demonstrating how to seamlessly integrate Redux and Redux Toolkit to efficiently manage global states. As we delve into the heart of this guide, you'll embark on a journey to streamline your development process, centralize state management, and amplify user experiences. By the end, you'll possess the knowledge to effectively reshape your architecture, yielding applications that are not only modular and scalable but also infused with the power of Redux-driven state management.

ReduxToolkit and React-Redux installation
In this section we will install redux and react-redux. Run the following command in the terminal: reference
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
 Redux Store Configuration
Create a folder called store in the src folder and create a file called index.ts inside it. You can run the following command in the terminal to create the folder and file:
mkdir src/store && touch src/store/index.ts
Copy the following code into the index.ts file reference:
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import counterReducer from "./features/counter/counterSlice";

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterReducer,
  },
});

export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>;
export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch;
 First Feature Slice (Counter)
Create a folder called features in the src/store folder and create a file called counter/counterSlice.ts inside it. You can run the following command in the terminal to create the folder and file:
mkdir src/store/features/counter && touch src/store/features/counter/counterSlice.ts
Copy the following code into the counterSlice.ts file:
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import type { PayloadAction } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

export interface CounterState {
  value: number;
}

const initialState: CounterState = {
  value: 0,
};

export const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: "counter",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      state.value += 1;
    },
    decrement: (state) => {
      state.value -= 1;
    },
    incrementByAmount: (state, action: PayloadAction<number>) => {
      state.value += action.payload;
    },
  },
});

export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = counterSlice.actions;

export default counterSlice.reducer;
 Creating a Types for the Store State
In this section we will create a types for the store state. Create a file called storeState.ts in the src/types folder. You can run the following command in the terminal to create the file:
touch src/types/storeState.ts
Copy the following code into the storeState.ts file:
// INFO (serif) : Counter State Types

export interface CounterState {
  value: number;
}
 Generate Types with @cloudbeds/webpack-module-federation-types-plugin (Optional)
In this section we will generate types for the store state. federation.config.json file is already configured to like below:
{
  "name": "container",
  "exposes": {
    "./Button": "./src/components/Button.tsx",
    "./types/storeState": "./src/types/storeState.ts"
  }
}
Run the following command in the terminal to generate types:
npx make-federated-types
container.d.ts looks like below:
// other types
declare module "container/types/storeState" {
  export interface CounterState {
    value: number;
  }
}
// other types
🎉 Congratulations! You have successfully generated types for the store state. After copy to the  container.d.ts file in remote application.

 Creating Hooks for Store
In this section we will create a custom hook to access the store and dispatch actions. Create a file called useStore.ts in the src/hooks folder. You can run the following command in the terminal to create the file:
touch src/hooks/useStore.ts
Copy the following code into the useStore.ts file:
import { useStoreDispatch } from "./useStoreDispatch";
import {
  decrement,
  increment,
  incrementByAmount,
} from "../store/features/counter/counterSlice";

export default function useStore() {
  const dispatch = useStoreDispatch();
  const incrementCounter = () => {
    dispatch(increment());
  };
  const decrementCounter = () => {
    dispatch(decrement());
  };
  const incrementByAmountCounter = (amount: number) => {
    dispatch(incrementByAmount(amount));
  };
  return { incrementCounter, decrementCounter, incrementByAmountCounter };
}
Create a file called useStoreDispatch.ts in the src/hooks folder. You can run the following command in the terminal to create the file:
touch src/hooks/useStoreDispatch.ts
Copy the following code into the useStoreDispatch.ts file:
import { useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import { AppDispatch } from "../store";

export const useStoreDispatch: () => AppDispatch = useDispatch;
Create a file called useStoreSelector.ts in the src/hooks folder. You can run the following command in the terminal to create the file:
touch src/hooks/useStoreSelector.ts
Copy the following code into the useStoreSelector.ts file:
import { useSelector } from "react-redux";
import type { TypedUseSelectorHook } from "react-redux";
import { RootState } from "../store";

export const useStoreSelector: TypedUseSelectorHook<RootState> = useSelector;
 Creating a Store Provider
In this section we will create a store provider component to wrap the application with. Create a file called StoreProvider.tsx in the src/providers folder. You can run the following command in the terminal to create the file:
touch src/providers/StoreProvider.tsx
Copy the following code into the StoreProvider.tsx file:
import React, { PropsWithChildren } from "react";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import { store } from "../store";

export default function ReduxProvider({ children }: PropsWithChildren) {
  return <Provider store={store}>{children}</Provider>;
}
 Wrapping the App with the Store Provider
In this section we will wrap the application with the store provider. Open the src/index.tsx file and wrap the App component with the StoreProvider component and it should look like the following:
import React, { Suspense } from "react";
import * as ReactDOMClient from "react-dom/client";

import "./index.css";
import StoreProvider from "./providers/StoreProvider";
const TestPage = React.lazy(() => import("remote/TestPage")); //? remote is the name of the container

const App = () => (
  <div className="max-w-6xl mx-auto mt-10 text-3xl text-red-600">
    <div>Name: container</div>
    <div>Framework: React</div>
    <div>Language: TypeScript</div>
    <div>CSS: Tailwind</div>
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <TestPage />
    </Suspense>
  </div>
);

const container = document.getElementById("app");
const root = ReactDOMClient.createRoot(container!);

root.render(
  <StoreProvider>
    <App />
  </StoreProvider>
);
 Export the Store, Store Selector and Store Provider in webpack
In this section we will export the store, store selector and store provider in webpack. Open the webpack.config.js file and add the following code to the exposes object:
const HtmlWebPackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");
const ModuleFederationPlugin = require("webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin");

const configs = {
  appName: "container",
  appFileName: "remoteEntry.js",
  development: {
    PUBLIC_PATH: "http://localhost:3000/",
    REMOTE_PATH: "remote@http://localhost:3001/remoteEntry.js",
    PORT: 3000,
  },
  production: {
    PUBLIC_PATH: "http://localhost:3000/",
    REMOTE_PATH: "remote@http://localhost:3001/remoteEntry.js",
    PORT: 3000,
  },
};

const deps = require("./package.json").dependencies;

module.exports = (env, argv) => {
  console.log({ env, argv, configs: configs[argv.mode] });

  return {
    output: {
      publicPath: configs[argv.mode].PUBLIC_PATH,
    },

    resolve: {
      extensions: [".tsx", ".ts", ".jsx", ".js", ".json"],
    },

    devServer: {
      hot: true,
      port: configs[argv.mode].PORT,
      historyApiFallback: true,
      allowedHosts: "all",
      headers: {
        "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
        "Access-Control-Allow-Headers":
          "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept",
      },
    },

    module: {
      rules: [
        {
          test: /\.m?js/,
          type: "javascript/auto",
          resolve: {
            fullySpecified: false,
          },
        },
        {
          test: /\.(css|s[ac]ss)$/i,
          use: ["style-loader", "css-loader", "postcss-loader"],
        },
        {
          test: /\.(ts|tsx|js|jsx)$/,
          exclude: /node_modules/,
          use: {
            loader: "babel-loader",
          },
        },
      ],
    },

    plugins: [
      new ModuleFederationPlugin({
        name: configs.appName,
        filename: configs.appFileName,
        remotes: {
          remote: configs[argv.mode].REMOTE_PATH,
        },
        exposes: {
          "./Button": "./src/components/Button.tsx",
          // INFO (serif) : We are exposing the store, store selector and store provider here
          "./hooks/useStore": "./src/hooks/useStore.ts",
          "./hooks/useStoreSelector": "./src/hooks/useStoreSelector.ts",
          "./providers/StoreProvider": "./src/providers/StoreProvider.tsx",
        },
        shared: {
          ...deps,
          react: {
            singleton: true,
            requiredVersion: deps.react,
          },
          "react-dom": {
            singleton: true,
            requiredVersion: deps["react-dom"],
          },
        },
      }),
      new HtmlWebPackPlugin({
        template: "./src/index.html",
      }),
    ],
  };
};
🎉 Congratulations! You have successfully configured Redux in your application.

 Next Step is to use the store in the remote application
In this section we will use the store in the remote application.

Firstly, we will define the type of the useStore hook in the container.d.ts file:
declare module "container/hooks/useStore" {
  function useStore(): {
    incrementCounter: () => void;
    decrementCounter: () => void;
    incrementByAmountCounter: (amount: number) => void;
  };

  export default useStore;
}
Secondly, we will define the type of the useStoreSelector hook in the container.d.ts file:
declare module "container/hooks/useStoreSelector" {
  import type { CounterState, ProductState } from "container/types/storeState";
  export type RootState = {
    counter: CounterState;
    product: ProductState;
  };

  export interface TypedUseSelectorHook<TState> {
    <TSelected>(selector: (state: TState) => TSelected): TSelected;
    <Selected = unknown>(selector: (state: TState) => Selected): Selected;
  }

  export const useStoreSelector: TypedUseSelectorHook<RootState>;
}
Lastly, we will define the type of the StoreProvider component in the container.d.ts file:
declare module "container/providers/StoreProvider" {
  import React from "react";

  type Props = {
    children: React.ReactNode;
  };
  export default function StoreProvider({ children }: Props): JSX.Element;
}
Wrap the App with the Store Provider
In this section we will wrap the application with the store provider. Open the src/App.tsx file and wrap the App component with the StoreProvider component and it should look like the following:
import React from "react";

import "./index.css";

import * as ReactDOMClient from "react-dom/client";

import Button from "container/Button";
import StoreProvider from "container/providers/StoreProvider";
console.log(Button);

const App = () => (
  <div className="max-w-6xl mx-auto mt-10 text-3xl text-blue-600">
    <div>Name: remote</div>
    <div>Framework: react</div>
    <div>Language: TypeScript</div>
    <div>CSS: Tailwind</div>
    <Button />
  </div>
);

const container = document.getElementById("app");
const root = ReactDOMClient.createRoot(container!);

root.render(
  <StoreProvider>
    <App />
  </StoreProvider>
);
 Use the store in the remote application
In this section we will use the store in the remote application. Open the src/pages/test/index.tsx file and add the following code:
import Button from "container/Button";
import useStore from "container/hooks/useStore";
import { useStoreSelector } from "container/hooks/useStoreSelector";
import React from "react";

export default function TestPage() {
  const {
    decrementCounter,
    incrementByAmountCounter,
    incrementCounter,
    getProductList,
  } = useStore();
  const {
    counter: { value },
    product: { products },
  } = useStoreSelector((state) => state);
  return (
    <div className="p-2 space-y-2 border">
      <label className="text-black">Test Page From Remote Application</label>
      <p>counter value : {value}</p>
      <section className="flex flex-row gap-x-4">
        <Button
          label="Decrement"
          buttonType={"error"}
          onClick={decrementCounter}
        />
        <Button
          label="Increment"
          buttonType={"primary"}
          onClick={incrementCounter}
        />
        <Button
          label="Increment by 5"
          buttonType={"warning"}
          onClick={() => incrementByAmountCounter(5)}
        />
        <Button
          label="Decrement by 5"
          buttonType={"info"}
          onClick={() => incrementByAmountCounter(-5)}
        />
        <Button
          label="Get All Product"
          buttonType={"secondary"}
          onClick={getProductList}
        />
      </section>
      <section className="grid grid-cols-4 gap-4">
        {products.map((product) => (
          <div
            className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center text-center text-black border-2 border-gray-300 rounded-lg gap-y-4"
            key={product.id}
          >
            <div>{product.brand}</div>
            <img
              src={product.images[0]}
              className="object-contain w-24 h-24"
              alt={product.brand}
            />
            <em>{product.price} $</em>
          </div>
        ))}
      </section>
    </div>
  );
}
🎉 Congratulations! You have successfully configured Redux in your application.

Create Async Thunk in the Container Application
In this section we will use the createAsyncThunk function in the container application.

Firstly, we will create a service for the product in the src/services file and name it product/index and add the following code:
import { ProductListResponse } from "./types";

export const getProductList = async (): Promise<ProductListResponse> => {
  const response = await fetch("https://dummyjson.com/products");
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
};
Add the ProductItem & ProducState type in the src/types/storeState file and it should look like the following:
// INFO (serif) : Product State Types
export interface ProductItem {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  price: number;
  discountPercentage: number;
  rating: number;
  stock: number;
  brand: string;
  category: string;
  thumbnail: string;
  images: string[];
}

export interface ProductState {
  products: ProductItem[];
}
// other types
Create type for the product in the src/services/product/types file and name it index and add the following code:
import { ProductItem } from "../../types/storeState";

export type ProductListResponse = {
  products: ProductItem[];
  limit: number;
  skip: number;
  total: number;
};
We create new slice in the src/store/features file and name it product and add productSlice.ts file in it. The productSlice.ts file should look like the following:
import { createAsyncThunk, createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import type { PayloadAction } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import { ProductItem, ProductState } from "../../../types/storeState";
import { getProductList } from "../../../services/product";

const initialState: ProductState = {
  products: [],
};

export const getAllProduct = createAsyncThunk(
  "product/getAllProduct",
  async () => {
    try {
      const list = await getProductList();
      return list.products;
    } catch (error) {
      throw new Error("Error while fetching products");
    }
  }
);

export const productSlice = createSlice({
  name: "product",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    setProducts: (state, action: PayloadAction<ProductItem[]>) => {
      state.products = action.payload;
    },
  },
  extraReducers: (builder) => {
    builder.addCase(getAllProduct.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
      state.products = action.payload;
    });
  },
});

export const { setProducts } = productSlice.actions;

export default productSlice.reducer;
Add the producSlice to src/store/index.ts file should look like the following:
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import counterReducer from "./features/counter/counterSlice";
import productReducer from "./features/product/productSlice";

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterReducer,
    product: productReducer,
  },
});

export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>;
export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch;
Add the getAllProduct to useStore hook in the src/container/hooks/useStore file and it should look like the following:
import { useStoreDispatch } from "./useStoreDispatch";
import {
  decrement,
  increment,
  incrementByAmount,
} from "../store/features/counter/counterSlice";
import { getAllProduct } from "../store/features/product/productSlice";

export default function useStore() {
  const dispatch = useStoreDispatch();
  const incrementCounter = () => {
    dispatch(increment());
  };
  const decrementCounter = () => {
    dispatch(decrement());
  };
  const incrementByAmountCounter = (amount: number) => {
    dispatch(incrementByAmount(amount));
  };

  const getProductList = () => {
    dispatch(getAllProduct());
  };

  return {
    incrementCounter,
    decrementCounter,
    incrementByAmountCounter,
    getProductList,
  };
}
🎉 Congratulations! You have successfully added getAllProduct thunk in your application. Let's invoke the function on remote application.

 Invoke the getAllProduct thunk in the remote application
In this section we will invoke the getAllProduct thunk in the remote application.

Firstly, we will update the useStore hook type on container.d.ts file and it should look like the following:
/* eslint-disable */
/// <reference types="react" />
declare module "container/Button" {
  import React, { ComponentProps } from "react";
  import { type VariantProps } from "class-variance-authority";
  type ButtonElementProps = ComponentProps<"button">;
  export interface ButtonProps
    extends ButtonElementProps,
      VariantProps<typeof buttonStyles> {
    label?: string;
    icon?: React.ReactNode;
    rightIcon?: React.ReactNode;
    buttonWrapperClassName?: string;
  }
  const buttonStyles: (
    props?:
      | ({
          buttonType?:
            | "error"
            | "default"
            | "success"

declare module "container/hooks/useStore" {

    incrementCounter: () => void;
    decrementCounter: () => void;
    incrementByAmountCounter: (amount: number) => void;
    getProductList: () => void;

  export default useStore;
}

Now, we will invoke the getProductList function in the remote application. src/pages/test/index.tsx file and it should look like the following:
import Button from "container/Button";
import useStore from "container/hooks/useStore";
import { useStoreSelector } from "container/hooks/useStoreSelector";
import React from "react";

export default function TestPage() {
  const {

    incrementByAmountCounter,
    incrementCounter,
    getProductList,
  } = useStore();
  const {
    counter: { value },
    product: { products },
  } = useStoreSelector((state) => state);
  return (
    <div className="space-y-2 ">
      <section className="grid grid-cols-4 gap-4">
        {products.map((product) => (
          <div
            className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center text-center text-black border-2 border-gray-300 rounded-lg gap-y-4"
            key={product.id}
          >
            <div>{product.brand}</div>
            <img
              src={product.images[0]}
              className="object-contain w-24 h-24"
              alt={product.brand}
            />
            <em>{product.price} $</em>
          </div>
        ))}
      </section>

      <h1 className="text-blue-600 md:text-gray-600">Test Page</h1>
      {value}
      <Button
        label="Decrement"
        buttonType={"error"}
        onClick={decrementCounter}
      />

      <Button
        label="Increment"
        buttonType={"primary"}
        onClick={incrementCounter}
      />
      <Button
        label="Increment by 5"
        buttonType={"warning"}
        onClick={() => incrementByAmountCounter(5)}
      />
      <Button
        label="Decrement by 5"
        buttonType={"info"}
        onClick={() => incrementByAmountCounter(-5)}
      />
      <Button
        label="Get All Product"

        onClick={getProductList}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
 Run the Container & Remote Application
In this section we will run the application. Open the terminal and run the following command:
cd container && npm run start
cd remote && npm run start
🎉 Congratulations! You have successfully configured Redux in your application.

 Conclusion
Redux and Redux Toolkit Installation: You started by installing Redux and Redux Toolkit using the provided npm command.

Redux Store Configuration: You created a centralized Redux store configuration, setting up the initial state and reducers for the counter feature.

Feature Slice Creation: You created a feature slice for the counter, which encapsulates the state and reducers specific to the counter feature.

Types for Store State: You defined types for the store state in a separate file to ensure type safety throughout your application.

Custom Hooks for Store: You created custom hooks for accessing the store and dispatching actions, abstracting away the complexity of directly interacting with Redux.

Store Provider Component: You created a store provider component to wrap your application and provide access to the Redux store to all components within the app.

Webpack Configuration: You configured Webpack to expose the necessary hooks, components, and types, allowing your remote application to access the Redux-related functionality from the container.

Async Thunk for Remote Application: You expanded the functionality by adding an asynchronous thunk for fetching product data, demonstrating how to fetch data from a remote source and update the store.

Using the Store in the Remote Application: You showcased how to use the custom hooks and selectors in the remote application, incorporating Redux state management seamlessly into your micro front-end architecture.

Running the Applications: Finally, you learned how to run both the container and remote applications concurrently to see your Redux-powered micro front-end in action.

By following this guide, you've gained a solid understanding of how to effectively integrate Redux and Redux Toolkit into a micro front-end architecture, enhancing the maintainability, scalability, and user experience of your applications. This approach allows you to create independent and reusable components while managing the state centrally, leading to more organized and efficient development processes.
